    		<h2>About Marathon Symphony Project</h2>
    		<p>This project starts during the New York City Marathon, where each runner is wearing a smart tag that records their bib number and time when they cross timing stations set at regular intervals along the course. This data is used for race results and is later analyzed by race organizers to understand aspects of the event like runner density at given times along the course.</p>
    		<p>The idea behind the Marathon Symphony Project is to conduct an experiment in sensory perceptions of data. Its goal is to give users an experience of data in a different way than the more common visual interpretations.</p>
			<p>The value of each musical note in the composition is generated based on the last digit of an individual runner's bib. The time that the note plays in the composition is based on the time that the runner crossed the selected station(s).</p>
			<p>The result is a musical interpretation of the data.</p>
