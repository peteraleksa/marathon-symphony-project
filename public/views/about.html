    		<h2>About Marathon Symphony Project</h2>
    		<p>This project starts with a pile of data left over from the New York City Marathon. Specifically data generated at timing stations set at regular intervals along the course. During the race every runner wears a smart tag on their shoe that records their bib number and the time when they cross each of the timing stations. This timing data is used initially for race results and is later analyzed by race organizers to understand aspects of the event like runner density at given times along the course.</p>
    		<p>The idea behind the Marathon Symphony Project is to conduct an experiment in sensory perceptions of data. Its goal is to give users an experience of data in a different way than the more common visual interpretations.</p>
			<p>The value of each musical note in the composition is generated based on the last digit of an individual runner's bib. The time that the note plays in the composition is based on the time that the runner crossed the selected station(s).</p>
			<p>The result is a musical interpretation of the data.</p>
			<p>The project was built using MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS, using the <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN.io</a> stack boilerplate.  The MIDI player on the front end uses <a href="http://mudcu.be/midi-js/">MIDI.js</a> and the backend makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/dingram/jsmidgen">jsmidgen</a> Node module to write the data in MIDI format.
